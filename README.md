Gem Search is a front end game that has a player use the arrow keys to move a green image around the screen to collect the blue image and to do so without touching the orange images. There is a levels option for easy and hard. Also there is a points tabby that keeps track of one's points. Gem Search uses object oriented design, with classes for the board, player, gem, opponents (called "traffic" after the frogger game).
